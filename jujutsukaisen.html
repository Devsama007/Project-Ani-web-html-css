    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>
      Idly indulging in baseless paranormal activities with the Occult Club, high schooler Yuuji Itadori spends his days
      at either the clubroom or the hospital, where he visits his bedridden grandfather. However, this leisurely
      lifestyle soon takes a turn for the strange when he unknowingly encounters a cursed item. Triggering a chain of
      supernatural occurrences, Yuuji finds himself suddenly thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from
      human malice and negativity—after swallowing the said item, revealed to be a finger belonging to the demon Sukuna
      Ryoumen, the "King of Curses." Yuuji experiences first-hand the threat these Curses pose to society as he
      discovers his own newfound powers. Introduced to the Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School, he begins
      to walk down a path from which he cannot return—the path of a Jujutsu sorcerer.
