    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>
      Yoichi Isagi was mere moments away from scoring a goal that would have sent his high school soccer team to the
      nationals, but a split-second decision to pass the ball to his teammate cost him that reality. Bitter, confused,
      and disappointed, Isagi wonders if the outcome would have been different had he not made the pass. When the young
      striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased
      decision-making process, Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected for a controversial project named
      Blue Lock.

      The project's ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the Japanese national
      team. To find the best participant, each diamond in the rough must compete against others through a series of solo
      and team competitions to rise to the top. Putting aside his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels
      compelled to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young
      strikers.
