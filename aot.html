    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>
      In the wake of Eren Yeager's cataclysmic actions, his friends and former enemies form an alliance against his
      genocidal rampage. Though once bitter foes, Armin Arlert, Mikasa Ackerman, and the remaining members of the Scout
      Regiment join forces with Reiner Braun and the survivors of the Marleyan military. Their meager united front sets
      out on a mission to stop Eren's wrath and—if possible—save their old comrade in the process.

      As Eren pushes forward at any cost, he battles his own internal turmoil. Although he feels immense remorse over
      his horrific invasion, Eren believes he harbors noble intentions: he believes the path ahead is the only way to
      save his friends and, to a greater extent, his people.

      The opposing battalions spiral toward an inevitable final clash that may claim the lives of millions. Though they
      face an army of monsters beyond anything they could have previously imagined, Mikasa, Armin, and their allies
      stand brave in the face of certain doom.
